# Communications

All reports, ranging from simple messages to fatal errors, must be reported through the comms system defined in this
directory.
This is done as to allow a uniform experience when using either consoles or IDEs!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to keep all your variables and functions inside the `Comms` namespace!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The use of the `throw` keyword is allowed within the `Comms` library!
